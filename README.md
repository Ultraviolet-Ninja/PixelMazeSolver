# Pixel Maze Solver
*You know? The program in that [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI) looked pretty cool! Imma implement it*
## Introduction
I wanted to make a simple UI to mimic the program from the Computerphile video on maze solving, just in Java.

## Maze Requirements
Can take in black and white mazes where the path is 1 pixel wide with the entrance being in the top and the bottom, the exit.
## How to generate mazes
- [Daedalus Link](http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm)
  - Is a bit of a learning curve
  - Might have to edit mazes to encase them in a black border
- [Website Link](https://keesiemeijer.github.io/maze-generator/#generate)
  - Limited to 200 x 200 size mazes
  - Set Wall thickness to 1
  - Set Maze entries to top and bottom
